Let say we have base object feature, and we have to add feature with base object feature, in that case we can wrap base feature
object with feature 2.

Now this feature 2 is also an object and in case of enhancing it's feature it can also be integrated with some
more additional feature

E.g. We have Base Pizza how we have variety of options for toppings, Now using decorator design pattern we can
decorate base pizza with different toppings depending upon customer requirements.
